## Key Features

### 1. Cross-Chain USDC Transfers

Juicy allows users to transfer USDC natively between major EVM-compatible chains—such as Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, and Linea—using Circle’s CCTP protocol. The process is simple: select your source and destination chains, and move your funds with ease.

---

### 2. Payment Requests & Merchant Tools

- Merchants can log in with Google and create payment requests for any amount, specifying their preferred destination chain.
- Juicy generates a unique payment link or QR code, which can be shared with customers for quick and easy payments.

---

### 3. Recovery Tool for Stuck Transfers

If a cross-chain transfer gets stuck (for example, USDC is burnt on the source chain but not minted on the destination), Juicy’s recovery tool makes it easy to resolve. Users simply enter the burn transaction details, and Juicy helps complete the process.

---

### 4. Borrowing and Lending

- Users can borrow USDC by locking ETH as collateral on any supported EVM chain.
- Choose where to receive your USDC, even if your collateral is on a different chain.
- For example, deposit ETH as collateral on Arbitrum and receive USDC on Base.

### 5. Loan Repayment and Collateral Release

Repaying loans is flexible and cross-chain:

- Enter your collateral ID and the loan creator’s wallet address to fetch loan details.
- Repay USDC on any supported chain.
- Juicy uses an on-chain oracle to verify repayments and release collateral automatically.

---

### 6. Powerful Dashboard

After logging in with Google, users and merchants gain access to a comprehensive dashboard:

- View all payment and loan history, with details on which chains you receive the most payments from.
- Manually withdraw funds from merchant sales or quick payment requests.
- Customize which chains you want to accept payments from, giving you full control over your business.
- Receive live notifications for every new payment.
- Add team members to your workspace for collaborative management.
- Set up a full merchant account, create a shop profile, and accept payments of any amount—just like a real online store.
