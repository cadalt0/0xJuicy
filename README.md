Juicy: The All-in-One Cross-Chain USDC Platform

Juicy is a next-generation platform designed to make USDC truly universal enabling seamless payments, requests, and lending across multiple blockchains. Whether you’re a merchant, a business, or an individual user, Juicy brings together everything you need to send, receive, request, and borrow USDC, all in one intuitive interface.

Key Features

1. Cross-Chain USDC Transfers

Juicy allows users to transfer USDC natively between major EVM-compatible chains, such as Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, and Linea, using Circle’s CCTP protocol. The process is simple: select your source and destination chains, enter the recipient’s address and amount, and Juicy guides you through burning USDC on the source chain and minting it on the destination. After completion, you can instantly verify the mint proof on a blockchain explorer, ensuring your USDC has arrived natively no bridges, no wrapped tokens.




2. Payment Requests & Merchant Tools

Merchants can log in with Google and create payment requests for any amount, specifying their preferred destination chain. Juicy generates a unique payment link or QR code, which can be shared with customers. Customers can pay these requests from any supported chain, making it easy for merchants to accept USDC from a global audience. Once payment is detected, Juicy’s backend automatically triggers an onchain oracle, which uses Circle’s CCTP v2 to settle funds on the merchant’s chosen chain delivering USDC instantly and securely.


3. Recovery Tool for Stuck Transfers

If a cross-chain transfer gets stuck (for example, USDC is burnt on the source chain but not minted on the destination), Juicy’s recovery tool makes it easy to resolve. Users simply enter the burn transaction hash, select the original source and destination chains, and provide the destination address. With one click, Juicy fetches the required attestation and enables the user to mint their USDC on the destination chain, ensuring funds are never lost.

4. Borrowing and Lending

Juicy enables users to borrow USDC by locking ETH as collateral on any supported EVM chain. Users can choose where to receive their USDC, even if their collateral is on a different chain. For example, you can lock ETH on Ethereum Sepolia and receive USDC on Linea Sepolia. If you have a strong transaction history or use a Metamask card, you may even receive extra USDC or additional benefits. All transactions are transparent and verifiable on the blockchain explorer.





5. Loan Repayment and Collateral Release

Repaying loans is flexible and cross-chain. Users enter their collateral ID and the loan creator’s wallet address to fetch loan details, then repay USDC on any supported chain. Juicy uses an onchain oracle to send a cross-chain message, automatically releasing the locked ETH collateral on the original chain. The process is seamless, typically taking about a minute, and can be completed using a Metamask card wallet for added convenience
